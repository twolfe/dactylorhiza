# Data file required to do enrichments of annotated differentially expressed genes

### Data
all_annotations_justGO.txt: File containing gene annotations obtained with Blast2Go.
both.transcripts.de.txt: Gene identifiers for differentially expressed resulting from the pipeline in https://github.com/twolfe/dactylorhiza/tree/master/differential-expression.
counts52KPS_de_results.txt: The differential expression results are found in /data/counts52KPS_de_results.txt. These results follow the pipeline in https://github.com/twolfe/dactylorhiza/tree/master/differential-expression.
datFileredCounts.txt: Counts of the filtered raw data obtained with https://github.com/twolfe/dactylorhiza/tree/master/differential-expression.
